			21.01.2022: Asking ICS-CERT/CISA for a status update<br />
			21.01.2022: ICS-CERT/CISA provides a new tracking number, and informs me that they have sent the report to the vendor but haven't heard back<br />
			08.02.2022: Asking ICS-CERT/CISA for a status update<br />
			24.02.2022: Asking ICS-CERT/CISA for a status update<br />
			10.03.2022: ICS-CERT/CISA informs me that the vendor has implemented a fix for the issues and that they are working on a schedule to release it to their customers<br />
			18.03.2022: ICS-CERT/CISA provides an advisory draft<br />
			18.03.2022: Asking ICS-CERT/CISA why the advisory draft only contains a single entry, even though I had reported multiple distinctive OS command injection vulnerabilities<br />
			22.03.2022: ICS-CERT/CISA informs me that the vendor argued that all reported vulnerabilities are only a single vulnerability, therefore ICS-CERT/CISA only assigned a single CVE. Moreover, ICS-CERT/CISA highlights that they always suggest that researchers should verify all fixes from vendors.<br />
			22.03.2022: Informing ICS-CERT/CISA that this statement is not correct, and that different functions get invoked depending on the specific request parameters. I'm further explaining that different fixes need to be implemented for each reported issue.<br />
			24.03.2022: ICS-CERT/CISA publishes the security advisory, still listing only a single entry<br />
