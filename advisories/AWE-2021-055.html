JPCERT/CC further states that they contacted Fuji Electric multiple times to identify which of the CVEs are assigned for the specific vulnerabilities that I discovered and reported, but that Fuji Electric has been unresponsive. Moreover, Fuji Electric did not inform JPCERT/CC when ICSA-21-299-01 from ICS-CERT was scheduled to be published.<br />
