			<th>Summary</th>
			<td>The specific flaw exists within the parsing of HMI files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated data structure. Local attackers are able to exploit this issue to  disclose information and to potentially execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Cscape EnvisionRV. User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability in that a user must open a malicious HMI file.</td>

			13.12.2021: Asking ICS-CERT/CISA for a status update<br />
			15.12.2021: ICS-CERT/CISA provides an advisory draft, which combined all 12 reported issues in a single entry, with CWE-20 and CVE-2021-44462. ICS-CERT/CISA further explains that all vulnerabilities are within the parser and therefore decided to group everything together under the label of missing input validation, as that is the root of the problem. Further, they ask me to review the draft and provide my feedback.<br />
			15.12.2021: Clarifying to ICS-CERT/CISA, that, in my opinion, it doesn't make sense to combine multiple different vulnerabilities into a single entry, without specifically listing the vulnerability types and number of vulnerabilities addressed. I further explained that this makes it difficult for any affected customers to correctly assess the potential risk, as the advisory data is incomplete, and that there are multiple different vulnerability types (Uninitialized Pointers, Out-of-Bound Reads, and Out-of-Bound Writes), different root causes and different exploit primitives.<br />
			20.12.2021: Asking ICS-CERT/CISA for an updated advisory draft<br />
			21.12.2021: Public release of security advisory by ICS-CERT/CISA, using the original draft that combined all issues within a single entry<br />
