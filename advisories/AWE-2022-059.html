			<th>Summary</th>
			<td>The application is vulnerable to multiple OS command injection vulnerabilities within different functions of the application, including the setApiPwd function, the setPwd function, the sendEmail function, the restoreBackup function, the createBackup function, the deleteBackup function and the updateFW function.<br /><br />
			The web server is listening by default on TCP ports 80/443 on all network interfaces and will be launched automatically on system startup. It is being executed in the context of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM on Windows systems and in the context of root on Linux systems. An authenticated remote attacker can exploit these issues to inject arbitrary OS commands which will get executed in the context of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Windows) or root (Linux).<br /><br />
			Since the vendor insisted that all highlighted issues stem from the same root cause, and CISA/ICS-CERT agreed with that statement, let's take a closer look. The following code snippets are taken from C:\Program Files\mySCADA\prj2\Scripts\main.js (v8.26.0), which contains the main application logic:<br /><br />
			<b>setApiPwd</b><br />
			The associated code for handling API passwords contains two different parameters, livePwd and histPwd:<br />

1794        var cmd = ""
1795        if(data.livePwd)

1798        }

			In line 1797, the command is constructed by concatenating various strings and parameters, including the user-controlled parameter livePwd, before passing it to an exec call on line 1807. The same pattern can be observed on line 1805, where the parameter histPwd is used instead.<br /><br />
			The following proof-of-concept can be used to trigger the issue (the following examples use admin:admin, as that is the default account of the application, but the issues can be triggered from other accounts too):<div class="scrollX"><pre><code class="language-bash">curl -u "admin:admin" -d '{"type":"setApiPwd","livePwd":"test\"&#x26;notepad"}' -X POST http://[IP]/sss2</code></pre></div>

			On lines 1558 and 1591, the user-controlled parameter filename is used directly and passed to the exec call which invokes the Backup binary. The vendor also put a TODO comment there to fix the vulnerability (I had reported previously multiple issues in myPRO, including this one and some of the others, which apparently should have already been fixed).<br /><br />

			On lines 1957, the command is constructed by concatenating a hardcoded string and the user-controlled parameter filename, before passing it to an exec call on the next line, 1958.<br /><br />
			The following proof-of-concept can be used to trigger the issue:<div class="scrollX"><pre><code class="language-bash">curl -u "admin:admin" -d '{"type":"updateFW","filename":"asdf & notepad"}' -X POST http://[IP]/sss2</code></pre></div><br /><br />
			It is quite obvious that the developers made the same mistake in terms of copying and pasting the vulnerable code pattern for different functions, but it is also quite clear that it's not a single vulnerability but multiple different ones of the same bug class. This is further illustrated when one considers the specific context in which these calls are executed - validating input to conform to a valid email address is likely going to be different from a filename or password. Since there are multiple exec calls, each of them must be addressed individually, which unfortunately hasn't been done (I tried to highlight this multiple times to ICS-CERT/CISA when I had requested individual CVEs to adequately catalogue and track the vulnerabilities reported). In one of my earlier reports, <a href="AWE-2021-069.html">AWE-2021-069</a>/<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-21-355-01">ICSA-21-355-01</a>, different CVEs were assigned, but for a subsequent report, <a href="AWE-2022-038.html">AWE-2022-038</a>/<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-083-02">ICSA-22-083-02</a>, no more (the vendor argued that I had just found multiple ways of exploiting a single vulnerability, which CISA/ICS-CERT seemed to have agreed with based on their advisory).</a><br /><br />
			Let's take a brief look at v8.27.0 (the <a href="https://www.myscada.org/changelog/?section=version-8-27-0">changelog</a> does not mention any security-related bug fixes), which the vendor stated fixed all reported issues, and which is accordingly listed in the advisory from CISA/ICS-CERT as the patched version: <br /><br />
			- setApiPwd (livePwd & histPwd) - original PoC works without modification<br />
			- setPwd - original PoC works without modification<br />
			- sendEmail - original PoC works without modification<br />
			- restoreBackup - original PoC does not work anymore:
			<div class="scrollX"><pre><code class="language-javascript">1562        if(data.filename.match(/^[0-9]{9,11}_P?D?S?.tar$/)){</code></pre></div><br />
			- createBackup - original PoC does not work anymore:<br />
			<div class="scrollX"><pre><code class="language-javascript">1663        if(data.manualType.match(/^(S?D?P?)$/)){</code></pre></div><br />
			- deleteBackup - original PoC does not work anymore:<br />
			<div class="scrollX"><pre><code class="language-javascript">1686        if(data.filename.match(/^[0-9]{9,11}_P?D?S?.tar$/)){</code></pre></div><br />
			- updateFW - original PoC works without modification<br /><br />
			Last week, on August 24, the vendor released <a href="https://www.myscada.org/changelog/?section=version-8-28-0">v8.28.0</a>, which does mention a "General security improvement", albeit not specifically referring to the myPRO product. While I didn't bother anymore looking for bypasses, let's also take a brief look at this latest version too by again simply executing the original PoCs:<br /><br />
			- setApiPwd (livePwd & histPwd) - original PoC works without modification<br />
			- setPwd - original PoC works without modification<br />
			- sendEmail - original PoC works without modification<br />
			- restoreBackup - original PoC does not work anymore (same fix as from v8.27.0).<br />
			- createBackup - original PoC does not work anymore (same fix as from v8.27.0).<br />
