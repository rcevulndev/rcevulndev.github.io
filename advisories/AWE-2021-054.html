			27.04.2021: Asking JPCERT/CC for a status update<br />
			28.04.2021: JPCERT/CC informs me that they are still waiting for a reply from the vendor<br />
			19.05.2021: Asking JPCERT/CC for a status update<br />
			19.05.2021: Received feedback from JPCERT/CC that the vendor plans to tentatively address the issues in October 2021<br />
			10.06.2021: Asking JPCERT/CC for a status update<br />
			10.06.2021: Received feedback that the tentative schedule for public disclosure remains October, after patches have been made available by the vendor<br />
			01.10.2021: Asking JPCERT/CC for a status update<br />
			02.10.2021: JPCERT/CC informs me that they will contact the vendor to ask for an update<br />
			26.10.2021: Asking for a status update, pointing out that ICS-CERT has published advisory icsa-21-299-01<br />
			27.10.2021: JPCERT/CC explains that Fuji Electric received the same vulnerabilities via ICS-CERT, which in turn received the reports from ZDI, and that Fuji Electric forgot to update JPCERT/CC. JPCERT/CC further states that they contacted Fuji Electric multiple times to identify which of the CVEs are assigned for the specific vulnerabilities that I discovered and reported, but that Fuji Electric has been unresponsive. Moreover, Fuji Electric did not inform JPCERT/CC when ICSA-21-299-01 from ICS-CERT was scheduled to be published.<br />
			26.05.2022: While trying to identify which specific CVEs match the vulnerabilities that I had identified and reported, it was discovered that none of them were bug collissions and that the initial statement from the vendor wasn't accurate. I'd like to thank JPCERT/CC for their efforts in the vendor communication and coordination process.<br />
